Next you are going to create your first project on your Github account.   

Follow the instructions in Classroom for "First Github Project".   This is the link you will use:  https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Repository-on-GitHub

Now that you have created it, clone it from git to your c:\Source\Git folder.

```
cd c:\Source\Git
git clone <repo link>
```

_You may get an error!_   

Why?  Because we have a folder called Portfolio already.   If you get this error, you can use this Terminal command to remove the folder on your local directory:

``` 
rmdir Portfolio
```

Now try to clone the repo again.
