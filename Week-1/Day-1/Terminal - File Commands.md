Follow along as I demonstrate these commands, then try them yourselves:



If you are not in the folder "C:\Source\Lessons\W1-D1", use your "ls" and "cd" commands to 
make sure you are.

Enter the command "touch index.html" and press Enter.  "touch" will create a new file for us.

```
touch index.html
```

Now enter the command "code index.html" and press Enter.   This will open the file in our editor!

```
code index.html
```

Use this file for the exercises in the rest of the lesson.
