            <p>I’m a full-stack developer with over 20 years of career experience as a manager and technical lead. I have championed
                and managed the implementation of projects and departmental policies, including: legacy software migrations,
                coding standards, source control standards and practices, data security policies, web services design, and
                database design. I frequently advise senior management regarding software purchases, business policies and
                procedures, and departmental objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal as a developer is to have a positive impact on society – either directly through the work that I produce or by working
                with organizations that have a strong social outreach. I love working in highly creative fields like media
                and the arts, and taking on new challenges with an understanding that creative solutions are worth the effort.
