        <p>I’m a full-stack developer with over 20 years of career experience as a manager and technical lead. I have championed
            and managed the implementation of projects and departmental policies, including: legacy software migrations,
            coding standards, source control standards and practices, data security policies, web services design, and database
            design. I frequently advise senior management regarding software purchases, business policies and procedures,
            and departmental objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal as a developer is to have a positive impact on society – either directly through the work that I produce or by working
            with organizations that have a strong social outreach. I love working in highly creative fields like media and
            the arts, and taking on new challenges with an understanding that creative solutions are worth the effort.
